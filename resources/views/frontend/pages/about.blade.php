			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In 1989, Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented World Wide Web. He developed the first Internet browser in 1990. The browser became open to general public in 1991. First forward 2018, 4 billion people around the world are using Internet. More than half the population of the world have access to Internet now. In 2017 alone, 250 million people around the world connected to the Internet for the first time.
<br>
Hence, it will not be an exaggeration to say that we are living in a connected world. Rapid development in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) made it affordable and easily accessible. Smartphones have become cheaper and mobile data prices also decreased. In 2017, more than 200 million people got their first mobile phones. More than half of the handsets used by people around the world are ‘smart’ devices.
<br>
“Information” is at the center of this technology. Using a simple smartphone, a person can get information about any country around the world or share information with billions of people living in different parts of the world. This globalization of knowledge and information caused major disruption in business, commerce and many other fields.
<br>
Now the million dollar question is-“How information is created?” Everyday, thousands of news outlets all over the world are publishing news reports reports. Then there are personal websites and blogs covering various subjects and issues. Business organizations, research organizations publish reports on a regular basis. Then there are video and audio contents uploaded by indviduals and various organizations. All these makes Internet a treasure trove of Information.
<br>
We all know about Google. It is currently, the most popular search engine in the world. Why do people visit Google? The answer is, “Information.” When a person types a search query in Google, it presents a list of web pages containing articles, reports, videos, charts, pertaining to that search query. For this reason, there is a saying, “Content is King or Queen.”
<br>
Bangladesh got its first computer in 1964. Atomic Energy Commission of Bangladesh brought the first mainframe computer IBM-1620. Internet came to Bangladesh in 1993.
<br>
Bangladesh Bank allowed online transaction in 2010 thus starting e-Commerce. As of June 2018, the country has 87.790 million Internet subscribers.
<br>
Despite tremendous growth in Internet usage, it failed to create a major impact in the lives of common people. There are various reasons behind this but one of the major reasons is lack of quality digital content in Bangla and English. Aside from few online news portals there are not many websites that publish quality digital contents on a regular basis that would fulfill various needs of the common people of our country.
<br>
Internet is not a luxury item but an integral part of our everyday life. Bangladeshi people use internet for online shopping, information, education and many other purposes. The use of Internet will only increase in future. At the same time, demand for good digital content will also increase. Noticing this trend, two entrepreneurs decided to establish a digital content company that will develop a wide range of quality contents for local and international companies. This is how Dhaka Cast came into being.</p>
<br>
<h1>About Dhaka Cast</h1>
<p>Dhaka Cast started its journey in 2018. Founders Prof. Dr. Mohammed Montasir Islam and  Dr. Fahreen Hannan are husband and wife. Both of them are healthcare professionals.
<br>
Digital content is an emerging market in Bangladesh. Thanks to the “Digital Bangladesh” initiative of the current government, Internet is more popular than ever and its usage is only increasing. More and more traditional businesses are moving to e-Commerce. Many companies are also offering services online. All this created huge demand for quality digital contents in Bangla and English language. Observing this rising trend, the couple decided to start a company that will produce digital content in Bangla and English for local as well as international companies. Dhaka Cast specializes in podcast, screen cast, web content, medical content, vodcast, and IVR.</p>
<br>
<h1>Why Dhaka Cast?</h1>

<h1>Message of Founder and Co-Founder: 
</h1>
<p><b>Dr. Fahreen Hannan 
<br>
BDS, MPH, Founder</b></p>
<p>According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 47.6 million people are young (10-24 year). The young people account for 30 percent of our country. Of these, 11 million are currently inactive. The unemployment rate is even higher among higher educated youth. This is a great tragedy for our country. I strongly believe that ICT sector is the only sector that can create jobs for these huge unemployed youth of our country.

Rise in e-Commerce, online shopping, social networking, internet usage drove the demand of digital content on Internet. Noticing this trend, I decided to start this company. My goal is to produce quality content in English and Bangla through this company. I want to establish Dhaka Cast as one of the pioneer companies in the digital content industry of Bangladesh.</p>

Today’s world is advancing  towards cloud computing day by day. Each and every person who is using a smartphone or a laptop is somehow and someway connected to cloud computing. No doubt, very soon in near future, every single person of the society will become totally dependent on cloud. Famous research organization IDC predicted that half of IT spending in USA will be cloud-based in 2018. According to Bain & Company subscription-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) will grow at an 18% CAGR by 2020. Here I just mentioned one trend. There are many such new trends that are changing our lives. With these developments, people will use technology to search for information. So we can say that the rate of consuming information will go further up in the future.  When I was a student in the school, I used to write essay “After getting up from sleep, the first thing we look for are a cup of tea and the daily newspaper.” Fast forward 2018, people, after getting up from sleep, fire up their smartphones and go through their social network feeds and online news. This is indicative of a huge change in the way we consume information these days. From print, we have moved online and this trend will only continue to grow. Hence, demand for digital content will only increase in the future. Realizing this trend, I decided to become a part of Dhaka Cast.</p>
